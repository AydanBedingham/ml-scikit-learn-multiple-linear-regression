# Scikit-Learn Multiple Linear Regression

Jupyter Notebook that uses Scikit-Learn to train a multiple linear regression machine learning model. The model loads an S&P 500 Stocks dataset and uses Employment statistics and Interest Rates to predict the Stock index Price.

* Load the 'S&P500_Stock_Data.csv' dataset
* Perform data visualization and basic exploratory data analysis
* Split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing 
* Train a machine linear regression model in Scikit-Learn
* Assess trained model performance
* Visualize the results in 3D
